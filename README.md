# MineSweeper Game

A web version of the classic MineSweeper game in a new style with adjustable dimensions and difficulty levels. Minesweeper is a logic-based game where the goal is to unveil all the squares in the grid without clicking on any mines. The numbers represent how many mines are in the adjacent 8 squares which act as clues to help you determine where the mines are.
